This the procedure for using TensorFlow with GPU(cuda) in Windows. The following are the steps which will keep you out of troubles(tried and tested!)
IF YOU INSTALL EVERYTHING IN THE DEFAULT DIRECTORIES, NO ENVIRONMENT ERRORS WILL COME(MOSTLY.)

INSTALLING VISUAL STUDIO
1. Install VS 2015(some people get issues with VS 2017, so check whichever is compatible with cuda toolkit).

INSTALLING CUDA
1. Download cuda toolkit 9.0 (Tensorflow currently has a support for it)
2. Verify the installation by following the guide on Cuda in windows available on the nvidia's webpage
3. Download cudnn 7 (currently cudnn 7.0 is supported with tensorflow).
4. Read the guide on using cudnn 7 in windows given on the nvidia's webpage.(otherwise you will get the environment related issues)

INSTALLING TENSORFLOW(I did it in my case using anaconda and pip, you can otherwise go by simple pip install(given on the tensorflow site)).
1. Install anaconda with python 3.5
2. Now for installing tensorflow with gpu either follow the instructions given on the tensorflow(if that doesnt give some errors) or run the following command
  "python -m pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu".
  The HTTPS errors can be removed by using the following command:
  "conda update anaconda-navigator" in the anaconda prompt.
3. Follow the validate your installation on the tensorflow webpage
